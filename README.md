## Notes to keep in mind

- The login page is mocked for simplicity. User management isnt implemented for this project.
- All problem sets on the dashboard are linked to the same question for the purpose of simplicity of this assignment.
- You can press the "CodeQuest" Header on the top of the page whenever you wish to go back to the dashboard.
- The API used for executing the code in a proper sandbox environment is powered with the help of [Judge0](https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce) by RapidAPI. The free tier of this API allows for a maximum of 50 requests per day so it might refuse to process your request if you go over 50.
